**Insights from the Project**

1. Sales Forecasting Accuracy
	• The ANN and SARIMAX models provided accurate predictions for weekly sales trends.
	• The time-series model captured seasonal patterns and holiday fluctuations well, improving planning for peak seasons.
2. Markdown Strategy Effectiveness
	• Markdowns, especially MarkDown1 and MarkDown2, significantly boosted sales during promotional periods.
	• However, excessive markdowns outside holiday weeks had limited effect, indicating markdowns are most effective during high-traffic periods.
3. Holiday vs Non-Holiday Impact
	• Holiday weeks (like Thanksgiving and Christmas) showed a 30–50% increase in sales across all store types.
	• Promotions combined with holidays had a multiplicative effect on sales.
4. Store Type Performance
	• Store Type A had consistently higher sales, likely due to larger size and inventory variety.
	• Store Type C underperformed, suggesting a potential area for optimization or reduced stocking.
5. Feature Impact
	• Features like CPI and unemployment had moderate correlation with sales in specific regions — economic indicators can be used to fine-tune inventory decisions.


**Recommendations**

1. Optimize Markdown Timing
	• Use markdowns strategically around holidays, especially in Store Types A and B.
	• Avoid frequent markdowns during low-traffic weeks, as they do not yield significant ROI.
2. Inventory & Stock Planning
	• Use the weekly forecasts to plan stock levels 2–3 weeks in advance.
	• Allocate more inventory to Store Type A during holiday seasons.
3. Automate Model Re-training
	• Retrain the model monthly with new sales data to keep the forecasts up to date.
	• Schedule retraining using cron jobs or Lambda (if hosted in AWS S3 + SageMaker in future versions).
4. Enhance User Dashboard
	• Add filters by department, region, and time range in Streamlit to give managers more control.
	• Consider integrating Power BI or Tableau dashboards for executive-level summaries.
